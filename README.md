# 👨‍💻 Harish Kumar - Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm a passionate developer focused on solving algorithmic challenges, building intelligent systems, and deploying ML-powered applications. This portfolio showcases my journey through programming, machine learning, and everything in between.

## 🚀 About Me

I thrive at the intersection of **competitive programming** and **machine learning innovation**. From optimizing Python code to designing privacy-aware NLP pipelines, I enjoy crafting solutions that are not only efficient but also impactful.

- 💡 Exploring advanced preprocessing techniques in machine learning
- 🧠 Designing NLP workflows for sensitive data detection and compliance
- 🔍 Practicing algorithms like recursion, dynamic programming, and graph traversal
- 🎯 Mastering Python nuances, regex for text processing, and PCA for dimensionality reduction

## 📂 Projects

### 🔐 PII Detection Pipeline  
Combines transformer-based NER models with custom regex rules to detect and redact sensitive information.

### 🚌 Bus Reservation System (Django)  
A web application for booking and managing bus seats, built with Django and Bootstrap.
